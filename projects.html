<h3>Matsya, autonomous underwater vehicle - october 2015 to present</h3>
<p> Matsya is an AUV designed and developed by a 30 member team of undergraduates spanning various branches of engineering like Electrical, Mechanical, Software and Materials science, at IIT Bombay. The team competes annually at the international RoboSub competition conducted by the AUVSI Foundation, San Diego, California, where we came second internationally last year.<br/>
My major contributions to the team include the DC-DC boost converter for powering up the thrusters and the motor driver module which cost around 20 percent of the market alternative, while at the same time providing twice the capacity. I have implemented hot swapping of batteries, allowing drained batteries to be replaced without switching off the on-board computer and at the same time providing an additional layer of safety in case of primary battery failure.</p>

<h3>Simulation of spiral RF inductors - April 2016</h3>
<p> I worked under Prof. Dipankar Saha, IIT Bombay, on the simulation and analysis of spiral RF inductors in the micron scale, using MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics. The major goals included finding a correlation between the trace thickness, width, number of turns and inductance value.<br/> The results of simulation and experiment was found to agree very well for the test cases.
    I managed to isolate the major cause of deviation from ideal behaviour for the studied models to the current leaking through the substrate. I also found out a rough estimate of the frequency at which the parasitic capacitance becomes dominant. I also tried out slightly modified models, which were found to have better characteristics than the original ones.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
