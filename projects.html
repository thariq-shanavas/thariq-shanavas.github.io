<h3>Matsya, autonomous underwater vehicle - october 2015 to present</h3>
<p> Matsya is an AUV designed and developed by a 30 member team of undergraduates spanning various branches of engineering like Electrical, Mechanical, Software and Materials science, at IIT Bombay. The team competes annually at the international RoboSub competition conducted by the AUVSI Foundation, San Diego, California, where we came second internationally last year.<br/>
My major contributions to the team include the DC-DC boost converter for powering up the thrusters and the motor driver module which cost around 20 percent of the market alternative, while at the same time providing twice the capacity. I have implemented hot swapping of batteries, allowing drained batteries to be replaced without switching off the on-board computer and at the same time providing an additional layer of safety in case of primary battery failure.</p>

<h3>Simulation of spiral RF inductors - April 2016</h3>
<p> I worked under Prof. Dipankar Saha, IIT Bombay, on the simulation and analysis of spiral RF inductors in the micron scale, using MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics. The major goals included finding a correlation between the trace thickness, width, number of turns and inductance value.<br/> 
    The results of simulation and experiment were found to agree very well for the test cases. I managed to isolate the major cause of deviation from ideal behaviour for the studied models to the current leaking through the substrate into the ground plane. I also roughly estimated the frequency at which the parasitic capacitance becomes dominant. I also tried out slightly modified models, which were found to have better characteristics than the original ones.

<h3>Plasma Speakers - April 2016</h3>
<p>Inspired from the movie 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice', the plasma speaker was a contraption designed to produce high frequency- high voltage pulses of electricity, which can be frequency modulated with an audio input. The spark generated produces corresponding isochoric changes in temperature of the surrounding air, which in turn lead to changes in pressure, which we percieve as sound.
