<h3>Undergraduate Thesis - July 2018 to November 2018 <br/>Magnetometry using Nitrogen-Vacancies in Diamond</h3>
      <p>I worked on designing the experimental setup for sensing weak magnetic fields at micron-scale resolution using nitrogen-vacancy(NV) centers in diamonds, under the guidance of <a href="http://home.iitb.ac.in/~pradeepsarin/"><font color = #0000FF> Prof. Pradeep Sarin</font></a> and <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/kasturis"><font color = #0000FF> Prof. Kasturi Saha</font></a> at IITB. We plan on using this as a tool to map propagating electric impulses in neuron cells. <br/>Implanting nitrogen atoms in the diamond lattice lead to a point defect, and together with the adjacent vacancy in the crystal, it forms a two-level quantum system. Rotations can be perfomed on the corresponding Bloch sphere using a microwave excitation. Making the RF field more uniform by replacing the current loops used perviously in the group with a microstrip antenna, I am able to use 57 percent more nitrogen-vacancies, corresponding to an expected shot-noise limited sensitivity improvement of 21 percent. <a href="reports/BTP_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Report</font></a> </p>
      
      

<h3>Research Internship, Tyndall National Institute, Ireland - May to July 2018 </h3>
    <p> I worked on developing machine learning techniques to extend the reach of Intensity Modulated/Direct detection photonic communication channels, under the guidance of <a href="http://physics.ucc.ie/?member=dr-cleitus-antony"><font color = #0000FF> Dr Cleitus Antony</font></a> and <a href="http://research.ucc.ie/profiles/E025/paul.townsend@tyndall.ie"><font color = #0000FF> Dr Paul Townsend</font></a>. I implemented feed forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks and a deep convolutional neural network at the receiver, and validated their performance against simulations and experiment. Using the convolutional network, I was able to demonstrate 20Gbps transmission across 30Km fibre, over hardware designed for 10Gbps. <br/>I also developed tools to intuitively visualise the weights learned by the neural network to gain insight into its working (Neural networks are typically treated as 'black boxes', since it's usually hard to make sense out of its parameters by simple observation). In addition, I started the work on using neural networks for pre-compensation within the group. You can find the report <a href="reports/Tyndall_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> here</font></a>.</p>
<h3>Research Internship, KEK: High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation, Japan - November to December 2017</h3>
      <p>I was involved in implementing control signals on an FPGA for a two-dimensional self triggered analog front end Pixel detector ASIC chip, guided by <a href="http://research.kek.jp/people/kisisita/"><font color = #0000FF> Dr Tetsuichi Kishishita</font></a> and <a href="http://www-esys.kek.jp/members/member-home-page/manobu-tanaka/tanakas-page"><font color = #0000FF> Prof Manobu Tanaka</font></a>. 
        The peak hold mechanism, following the signal conditioning circuit to facilitate data readout was suitably timed with the trigger system. 
        The data is digitized by an analog to digital converter and logged into the PC through the FPGA. 
        I also worked on noise optimisation of the signal conditioning circuit in the same ASIC chip for future iterations.

<h3>Research Internship, University of Alberta - May 2017 to July 2017 <br/>Analytical Modelling of Photonic Nanostructures</h3>
      <p>I was involved in the modelling of titanuim nitride coated titanium dioxide nanostructures, under the guidance of <a href="https://ece.engineering.ualberta.ca/en/FacultyStaff/FacultyAcademic/KarthikShankar.aspx"><font color = #0000FF> Dr Karthik Shankar</font></a>, Department of Electrical and computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada.
       <br/>I made analytical predictions on the strength and frequency of surface plasmon resonance by modifying Gans theory for a composite material, and supported my calculations with numerical FEM simulations. As the culmination of my internship, I co-authored a paper on our findings to IOP-Nanotechnology. </p>
