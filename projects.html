<h3>Research Internship, Tyndall National Institute, Ireland - May 2018 to July 2018 <br/>Application of Neural Networks to extend the reach of photonic communication networks</h3>
      <p>I am currently working on evaluating the applicability of neural networks to improve optical communication channels. I am specifically working on pre-distortion techniques and adaptive equalisers.</p>
<h3>Research Internship, KEK: High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation, Japan - November 2017 to present</h3>
      <p>I was involved in implementing control signals on an FPGA for a two-dimensional self triggered analog front end Pixel detector ASIC chip. 
        The peak hold mechanism, following the signal conditioning circuit to facilitate data readout was suitably timed with the trigger system. 
        The data is digitized by an analog to digital converter and logged into the PC through the FPGA. 
        I also worked on noise optimisation of the signal conditioning circuit in the same ASIC chip for future iterations. <a href="/reports/KEK_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Report</font></a> </p>

<h3>Research Internship, University of Alberta - May 2017 to July 2017 <br/>Analytical Modelling of Photonic Nanostructures</h3>
      <p>Numerically simulated and analytically modelled the optical properties of titanium dioxide nanostructures using electromagnetic theory, 
       under the guidance of <a href="https://ece.engineering.ualberta.ca/en/FacultyStaff/FacultyAcademic/KarthikShankar.aspx"><font color = #0000FF> Dr Karthik Shankar</font></a>, Department of Electrical and computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada.
       <br/>I have theoretically modelled the observed surface plasmon resonances of the TiN coated TiO2 nanotubes, using effective medium theories and the exact Gans theory. Calculations agreed very well with experimental data.</p>

<h3>Particle discrimination using Machine learning and matched filtering - Course project for EE338: Digital Signal Processing</h3>


<h3>Forgery detection of images using statistical analysis - Course project for EE325: Probability and Random Processes</h3>
      <p>We extracted several statistical features from test images to detect copy-move forgery. We performed a fourier transform of the suspicious parts of the image, and compared the statistical moments in the fourier domain. <a href="/reports/EE325_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Report</font></a>. <a href="/reports/EE325_Presentation.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Presentation</font></a> </p>  

<h3>Design of a Multicycle RISC Microprocessor - Course project for EE309: Microprocessors</h3>
      <p>Designed a full fledged RISC microprocessor along with memory, and implemented it on an FPGA. We were able to execute simple programs, and the results were verified on a PC. <a href="/reports/EE309_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Report</font></a></p>

 <h3>FPGA based Muon Tracker - August 2017 to present</h3>
      <p>I am currently working on developing a scalable FPGA based system to trace the path of muons from a detector matrix.</p>
<h3>Calibrated Pulse Generator - January 2017 to Apr 2017</h3>
      <p>Involved in the design of a high precision GHz - level pulse (approx. 10,000 electrons) generator for the purpose of calibrating Semiconductor detectors in high energy experimental Particle Physics. Guided by <a href="http://home.iitb.ac.in/~pradeepsarin"><font color = #0000FF> Professor Pradeep Sarin</font></a> from the Physics Department, IIT Bombay.</p>
          
<h3>Decentralised coverage control of mobile robots - november 2016 to Feb 2017</h3>
      <p> I worked on the control and coordination of decentralised autonomous agents with <a href="http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~srikant/"><font color = #0000FF> Professor Srikant Sukumar</font></a>, Systems and Control Engineering, IIT Bombay.
      The propsed controller is suitable for decentralised sensing and action, for example, cleaning up oil spills or sensing nuclear radiation. A Lyapunov-type proof has been proposed for the stability and convergence of the system. The numerical simulations are found to agree very well with the coverage objective.</p>

<h3>Matsya, autonomous underwater vehicle - october 2015 to October 2016</h3>
      <p> Matsya is an AUV designed and developed by a 30 member team of undergraduates spanning various branches of engineering like Electrical, Mechanical, Software and Materials science, at IIT Bombay. 
        The team competes annually at the international RoboSub competition conducted by the AUVSI Foundation, San Diego, California, where we came second internationally last year.<br/>
      My major contributions to the team include the DC-DC boost converter for powering up the thrusters and the motor driver module which cost around 20 percent of the market alternative, while at the same time providing twice the capacity. 
        I have implemented hot swapping of batteries, allowing drained batteries to be replaced without switching off the on-board computer and at the same time providing an additional layer of safety in case of primary battery failure.</p>
<h3>Simulation of spiral RF inductors - April 2016 to June 2016</h3>
      <p> I worked under <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dsaha"><font color = #0000FF>Prof. Dipankar Saha</font></a>, IIT Bombay, on the simulation and analysis of spiral RF inductors in the micron scale, using MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics. 
        The major goals included finding a correlation between the trace thickness, width, number of turns and inductance value.<br/> 
      The results of simulation and experiment were found to agree very well for the test cases. I managed to isolate the major cause of deviation from ideal behaviour for the studied models to the current leaking through the substrate into the ground plane. 
        I also roughly estimated the frequency at which the parasitic capacitance becomes dominant. I also tried out slightly modified models, which were found to have better characteristics than the original ones.</p>
          
          

<h3>Plasma Speakers - April 2016</h3>
      <p>Inspired from the movie 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice', the plasma speaker was a contraption designed to produce high frequency- high voltage pulses of electricity, which can be frequency modulated with an audio input. 
        The spark generated produces corresponding isochoric changes in temperature of the surrounding air, which in turn lead to changes in pressure, which we percieve as sound.
