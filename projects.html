<h3>Undergraduate Thesis - July 2018 to November 2018 <br/>Magnetometry using Nitrogen-Vacancies in Diamond</h3>
      <p>I worked on designing the experimental setup for sensing weak magnetic fields at micron-scale resolution using nitrogen-vacancy(NV) centers in diamonds, under the guidance of <a href="http://home.iitb.ac.in/~pradeepsarin/"><font color = #0000FF> Prof. Pradeep Sarin</font></a> and <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/kasturis"><font color = #0000FF> Prof. Kasturi Saha</font></a> at IITB. We plan on using this as a tool to map propagating electric impulses in neuron cells. <br/>Implanting nitrogen atoms in the diamond lattice lead to a point defect, and together with the adjacent vacancy in the crystal, it forms a two-level quantum system. Rotations can be perfomed on the corresponding Bloch sphere using a microwave excitation. Making the RF field more uniform by replacing the current loops used perviously in the group with a microstrip antenna, I am able to use 57 percent more nitrogen-vacancies, corresponding to an expected shot-noise limited sensitivity improvement of 21 percent. <a href="reports/BTP_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Report</font></a> </p>
      
      

<h3>Research Internship, Tyndall National Institute, Ireland - May to July 2018 </h3>
    <p> I worked on developing machine learning techniques to extend the reach of Intensity Modulated/Direct detection photonic communication channels, under the guidance of <a href="http://physics.ucc.ie/?member=dr-cleitus-antony"><font color = #0000FF> Dr Cleitus Antony</font></a> and <a href="http://research.ucc.ie/profiles/E025/paul.townsend@tyndall.ie"><font color = #0000FF> Dr Paul Townsend</font></a>. I implemented feed forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks and a deep convolutional neural network at the receiver, and validated their performance against simulations and experiment. Using the convolutional network, I was able to demonstrate 20Gbps transmission across 30Km fibre, over hardware designed for 10Gbps. <br/>I also developed tools to intuitively visualise the weights learned by the neural network to gain insight into its working (Neural networks are typically treated as 'black boxes', since it's usually hard to make sense out of its parameters by simple observation). In addition, I started the work on using neural networks for pre-compensation within the group. You can find the report <a href="reports/Tyndall_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> here</font></a>.</p>
<h3>Research Internship, KEK: High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation, Japan - November to December 2017</h3>
      <p>I was involved in implementing control signals on an FPGA for a two-dimensional self triggered analog front end Pixel detector ASIC chip, guided by <a href="http://research.kek.jp/people/kisisita/"><font color = #0000FF> Dr Tetsuichi Kishishita</font></a> and <a href="http://www-esys.kek.jp/members/member-home-page/manobu-tanaka/tanakas-page"><font color = #0000FF> Prof Manobu Tanaka</font></a>. 
        The peak hold mechanism, following the signal conditioning circuit to facilitate data readout was suitably timed with the trigger system. 
        The data is digitized by an analog to digital converter and logged into the PC through the FPGA. 
        I also worked on noise optimisation of the signal conditioning circuit in the same ASIC chip for future iterations.

<h3>Research Internship, University of Alberta - May 2017 to July 2017 <br/>Analytical Modelling of Photonic Nanostructures</h3>
      <p>I was involved in the modelling of titanuim nitride coated titanium dioxide nanostructures, under the guidance of <a href="https://ece.engineering.ualberta.ca/en/FacultyStaff/FacultyAcademic/KarthikShankar.aspx"><font color = #0000FF> Dr Karthik Shankar</font></a>, Department of Electrical and computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada.
       <br/>I made analytical predictions on the strength and frequency of surface plasmon resonance by modifying Gans theory for a composite material, and supported my calculations with numerical FEM simulations. As the culmination of my internship, I co-authored a paper on our findings to IOP-Nanotechnology. </p>

<h3>Molecular Thermoelectrics using NEGF formalism
    <br/>Course project, EE755: Quantum transport in nanoscale devices</h3>
    <p> Using Non-equilibrium Green's Function formalism, I modeled the charge transport phenomena in Phenyl dithiol molecule with focus on its thermoelectric properties. The transport dynamics is determined by the position of the Fermi level with respect to the molecular energy levels - Comparing the inferences from the model with experimental evidence from literature, I concluded that the charge transport is dominated by the highest occupied molecular orbital, and that the charge carriers are primarily holes. <a href="reports/EE755_Poster.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Poster</font></a>. <a href="reports/EE755_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Report</font></a></p>

<h3>Particle discrimination using Machine learning and matched filtering 
    <br/>Course project, EE338: Digital Signal Processing</h3>
    <p> We compared machine learning and matched filtering for distinguishing between electrons and pions from the signal of a scintillation detector.
      We proposed a theoretical model of the signal for the case of electron and pion. The model matched very well with available data.
      This model was used to generate a training sample to train the regression classifier, and also as the reference for the matched filter.
      Both classifiers gave over 99 percent accuracy under reasonable noise conditions.

<h3>Training Probabilistic Spiking Neuron Networks with First-to-spike Decoding
    <br/>Course project, EE746:Neuromorphic Engineering</h3>
    <p>Neurons in the human brain communicate by means of sparse spiking processes. Most existing algorithms of practical implementation of SNNs are based on variations of the unsupervised mechanism of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), which updates synaptic weights based on local input and output spikes. We implemented a first-to-spike decoding rule, whereby the SNN can perform an early classification decision once a spike firing is detected at an output neuron. This generally reduces decision latency and complexity during the inference phase. <a href="reports/Neuro_Poster.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Poster</font></a>. <a href="reports/EE746_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Report</font></a></p>


<h3>Forgery detection of images using statistical analysis 
    <br/>Course project, EE325: Probability and Random Processes</h3>
      <p>We extracted several statistical features from test images to detect copy-move forgery. 
        We performed a fourier transform of the suspicious parts of the image, and compared the statistical moments in the fourier domain. <a href="reports/EE325_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Report</font></a>.

<h3>Design of a Multicycle RISC Microprocessor 
    <br/>Course project, EE309: Microprocessors</h3>
      <p>Designed a full fledged RISC microprocessor along with memory, and implemented it on an FPGA. We were able to execute simple programs, and the results were verified on a PC. <a href="reports/EE309_Report.pdf"><font color = #0000FF> Report</font></a></p>

<h3>Calibrated Pulse Generator - January 2017 to Apr 2017</h3>
      <p>Involved in the design of a high precision GHz - level pulse (approx. 10,000 electrons) generator for the purpose of calibrating Semiconductor detectors in high energy experimental Particle Physics. 
        Guided by <a href="http://home.iitb.ac.in/~pradeepsarin"><font color = #0000FF> Professor Pradeep Sarin</font></a> from the Physics Department, IIT Bombay.</p>
          
<h3>Decentralised coverage control of mobile robots - november 2016 to Feb 2017</h3>
      <p> I worked on the control and coordination of decentralised autonomous agents with <a href="http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~srikant/"><font color = #0000FF> Professor Srikant Sukumar</font></a>, Systems and Control Engineering, IIT Bombay.
      The propsed controller is suitable for decentralised sensing and action, for example, cleaning up oil spills or sensing nuclear radiation. A Lyapunov-type proof has been proposed for the stability and convergence of the system. 
        The numerical simulations are found to agree very well with the coverage objective.</p>

<h3>Matsya, autonomous underwater vehicle - october 2015 to October 2016</h3>
      <p> Matsya is an AUV designed and developed by a 30 member team of undergraduates spanning various branches of engineering like Electrical, Mechanical, Software and Materials science, at IIT Bombay. 
        The team competes annually at the international RoboSub competition conducted by the AUVSI Foundation, San Diego, California, where we came second internationally last year.<br/>
      My major contributions to the team include the DC-DC boost converter for powering up the thrusters and the motor driver module which cost around 20 percent of the market alternative, while at the same time providing twice the capacity. 
        I have implemented hot swapping of batteries, allowing drained batteries to be replaced without switching off the on-board computer and at the same time providing an additional layer of safety in case of primary battery failure.</p>

<h3>Simulation of spiral RF inductors - April 2016 to June 2016</h3>
      <p> I worked under <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dsaha"><font color = #0000FF>Prof. Dipankar Saha</font></a>, IIT Bombay, on the simulation and analysis of spiral RF inductors in the micron scale, using MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics. 
        The major goals included finding a correlation between the trace thickness, width, number of turns and inductance value.<br/> 
      The results of simulation and experiment were found to agree very well for the test cases. I managed to isolate the major cause of deviation from ideal behaviour for the studied models to the current leaking through the substrate into the ground plane. 
        I also roughly estimated the frequency at which the parasitic capacitance becomes dominant. I also tried out slightly modified models, which were found to have better characteristics than the original ones.</p>          

<h3>Plasma Speakers - April 2016</h3>
      <p>Inspired from the movie 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice', the plasma speaker was a contraption designed to produce high frequency- high voltage pulses of electricity, which can be frequency modulated with an audio input. 
        The spark generated produces corresponding isochoric changes in temperature of the surrounding air, which in turn lead to changes in pressure, which we percieve as sound.
